# This IG uses US Core 6.1.0 because of TEFCA requirements
The ImplementationGuide uses package hl7.fhir.us.core#6.1.0 released on 2023-06-30, but the most recent appropriate version is 8.0.0. This reference is getting old and the more recent version should be considered

# Variance Request from CGP for the profiles that are not derived from US Core - https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-46489
WARNING: StructureDefinition.where(url = 'http://hl7.org/fhir/us/identity-matching/StructureDefinition/IDI-Patient').baseDefinition: US FHIR Usage rules require that all profiles on Patient derive from the core US profile. See https://confluence.hl7.org/display/CGP/US+Core+Variance+Request+Process
WARNING: StructureDefinition.where(url = 'http://hl7.org/fhir/us/identity-matching/StructureDefinition/IDI-Patient-L0').baseDefinition: US FHIR Usage rules require that all profiles on Patient derive from the core US profile.

# Variance Request from CGP for new profiles in STU2 that are not derived from US Core - https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-51611

# INFORMATION: This Code System is only defined for this IG and is not needed outside of this IG
INFORMATION: CodeSystem/Identity-Identifier-cs: CodeSystem: Most code systems defined in HL7 IGs will need to move to THO later during the process. Consider giving this code system a THO URL now (See https://confluence.hl7.org/display/TSMG/Terminology+Play+Book, and/or talk to TSMG)

# The SUSHI Generated Patient does have generated narrative, but SUSHI seems to NOT create narrative for resources referenced from a Parameters resource
Constraint failed: dom-6: 'A resource should have narrative for robust management' (defined in http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/DomainResource) (Best Practice Recommendation)

# The profiles in this IG are intentionally similar, and a give instance may match 1 or several of the profiles. The meta profile for this instance indicates it conforms to IDI-Patient, which is one of the legal choices.
Found multiple matching profiles among 4 choices: http://hl7.org/fhir/us/identity-matching/StructureDefinition/IDI-Patient, http://hl7.org/fhir/us/identity-matching/StructureDefinition/IDI-Patient-L0, http://hl7.org/fhir/us/identity-matching/StructureDefinition/IDI-Patient-L1, http://hl7.org/fhir/us/identity-matching/StructureDefinition/IDI-Patient-L2
The parameter resource matched more than one of the allowed profiles (http://hl7.org/fhir/us/identity-matching/StructureDefinition/IDI-Patient, http://hl7.org/fhir/us/identity-matching/StructureDefinition/IDI-Patient-L0, http://hl7.org/fhir/us/identity-matching/StructureDefinition/IDI-Patient-L1, http://hl7.org/fhir/us/identity-matching/StructureDefinition/IDI-Patient-L2)
This element does not match any known slice defined in the profile http://hl7.org/fhir/us/identity-matching/StructureDefinition/IDI-Patient-L0|2.0.0 (this may not be a problem, but you should check that it's not intended to match a slice)
This element does not match any known slice defined in the profile http://hl7.org/fhir/us/identity-matching/StructureDefinition/IDI-Patient-L1|2.0.0 (this may not be a problem, but you should check that it's not intended to match a slice)
This element does not match any known slice defined in the profile http://hl7.org/fhir/us/identity-matching/StructureDefinition/IDI-Patient-L2|2.0.0 (this may not be a problem, but you should check that it's not intended to match a slice)

# The self-link for these searchset bundles is to the $IDI-match operation and not to a FHIR search string
No types could be determined from the search string, so the types can't be checked

# INFORMATION: Inherited deprecated element from R4
The extension http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/elementdefinition-maxValueSet|5.2.0 is deprecated

# INFORMATION: Ignoring conformance language message for STU2
The html source contains the word 'SHALL' but it is not in a text phrase marked as a conformance clause
