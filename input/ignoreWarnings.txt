# This IG uses US Core 6.1.0 because of TEFCA requirements
The ImplementationGuide uses package hl7.fhir.us.core#6.1.0 released on 2023-06-30, but the most recent appropriate version is 8.0.0. This reference is getting old and the more recent version should be considered

# Variance Request from CGP for the profiles that are not derived from US Core - https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-46489
WARNING: StructureDefinition.where(url = 'http://hl7.org/fhir/us/identity-matching/StructureDefinition/IDI-Patient').baseDefinition: US FHIR Usage rules require that all profiles on Patient derive from the core US profile. See https://confluence.hl7.org/display/CGP/US+Core+Variance+Request+Process
WARNING: StructureDefinition.where(url = 'http://hl7.org/fhir/us/identity-matching/StructureDefinition/IDI-Patient-L0').baseDefinition: US FHIR Usage rules require that all profiles on Patient derive from the core US profile.

# INFORMATION: Will leave for an STU Update with the intent to make the change during a major version
Most code systems defined in HL7 IGs will need to move to THO later during the process. Consider giving this code system a THO URL now (See https://confluence.hl7.org/display/TSMG/Terminology+Play+Book, and/or talk to TSMG)

# The SUSHI Generated Patient does have generated narrative, but SUSHI seems to NOT create narrative for resources referenced from a Parameters resource
Constraint failed: dom-6: 'A resource should have narrative for robust management' (defined in http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/DomainResource) (Best Practice Recommendation)

# The profiles in this IG are intentionally similar, and a give instance may match 1 or several of the profiles. The meta profile for this instance indicates it conforms to IDI-Patient, which is one of the legal choices.
Found multiple matching profiles among 3 choices: http://hl7.org/fhir/us/identity-matching/StructureDefinition/IDI-Patient, http://hl7.org/fhir/us/identity-matching/StructureDefinition/IDI-Patient-L0, http://hl7.org/fhir/us/identity-matching/StructureDefinition/IDI-Patient-L1
