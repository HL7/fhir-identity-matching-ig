### Package File 

The following package file includes an NPM package file used by many FHIR tools. It includes all the value sets, profiles, extensions, list of pages and URLs in the implementation guide (IG), etc. for this version of the IG. This file contains all of the rules about what makes the profiles valid and should be the first choice when generating any implementation artifacts. Implementers will still need to be familiar with the contents of this specification and the applicable profiles to make a conformant implementation. See the overview on validating [FHIR profiles and resources](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/validation.html):
