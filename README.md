## View the IG

### [Current build](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-identity-matching-ig/branches/master/)

## Scope

This project is intended to enhance interoperability among patient matching and digital identity management approaches. It will leverage and build on existing and emerging standards and augment with best practices for identity verification. This is currently a gap not addressed directly by other identity related efforts.
